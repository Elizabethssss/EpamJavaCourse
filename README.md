This repository contains my homework from Epam Java Winter Courses.
# Lesson 1
[**Task 1**](https://github.com/Elizabethssss/EpamJavaCourse/tree/master/Lesson1/src/task1) - console application that defines a positive integer number in the decimal number system, and then converts the number into binary/ternary/octal/hexadecimal number systems and prints the result.

[**Task 2**](https://github.com/Elizabethssss/EpamJavaCourse/tree/master/Lesson1/src/task2) - console application that finds all perfect numbers in the range of 1 to some given positive number and prints them (the perfect number is number that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. For instance, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3).

[**Task 3**](https://github.com/Elizabethssss/EpamJavaCourse/tree/master/Lesson1/src/task3) - console application that calls method for building the piramide with a height ranging from 1 to 9. For example, piramide of height = 4:
   1
  121
 12321 
1234321  

[**Task 4**](https://github.com/Elizabethssss/EpamJavaCourse/tree/master/Lesson1/src/task4) - console application which rotates a square matrix of dimension N 90 Â° counterclockwise. The values of matrix elements are set using a random numbers generator. The matrix should contain both positive and negative values. To check the result, you need to display a given matrix and after processing.
